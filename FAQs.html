<h2>What is Zero Waste About?</h2>

		<p>The term "Zero Waste" means making the conscious effort to reduce the amount of waste you send to landfill. You can do this by reusing, recycling, repairing and composting instead and being more aware of the purchases you make that would prevent waste in the future. See the <a href="products.html">Products</a> page of our website for some items that will help you kick start your Zero Waste journey.</p>

<h2>Will it cost me anything?</h2>

		<p>At the beginning there may me some additional costs for example, purchasing a Keepcup but the rewards in return are huge. You can make your morning coffee at home and bring on your journey therefore saving money in the long run. Saying NO to disposable items will cost you nothing. Be prepared, carry a cloth bag for shopping, always say NO to plastic straws and bags. Choose cans over plastic bottles or even better buy a reusable bottle and fill at home or work. A bottle of water in Dublin can cost up to &euro;1.50 or more. Outrageous!</p>

<h2>Is Recycling not enough?</h2>

		<p>Although recycling is great and definitely helps in the fight against waste and pollution, we need to change our mentality from Recycling and move to Sustainability by reducing our waste FULL STOP. Recycled plastic rarely is used to make new plastic. Plastics are made from fossil fuels such as oil and gas. Most fossil-based plastics are non-biodegradable meaning they will still be around long after we are. They do degrade, into smaller and smaller pieces and end up being eaten by marine life and other animals thus entering our food chain.</p>

<h2>Where do I start?</h2>
